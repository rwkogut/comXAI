# comXAI
# Overview

This repository contains an applicaiton used for the testing of machine learning datasets. More specifically, it compares the combinations of a class data-set to a non-class(nominal) datasets. It outputs information related to the appearnence of certains combinations of inputs found in the class set that are also found in the non-class data set.

# Implemented Features 

GUI interface using the Python Tkinter library
2,3,4,5,6-way combinatorial testing and output
2,3,4-way combinatorial testing coverage graphs 

# Non-Implemented features 
Cython, Numba, and Pypy performance improvements
String to int mapping 

# Dependencies 
None. All current work is included in standard Python frameworks.

# Compilation and running instructions 

The code must be run using a Python 3 compiler. Simply run the program with the Python 3 compiler and a GUI window will appear for use.

Once the GUI window has been launched there will be buttons that allow you to input class and nominal (non-class) files. Select the level of coverage and click the run button and the program will run and output the statistics to the output window in the GUI.
